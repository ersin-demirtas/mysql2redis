[MySQL2Redis][]
===============

-----
Updated to work with MySQL 5.7
-----




This is a [user-defined function (UDF) ][UDF] plugin for MySQL, which can
provide some [redis][Redis] command support function
to push data from MySQL to Redis.

This application just test on CentOS 6.2(Final),MySQL Server 5.1 and 5.5.
In a Dell Server PowerEdge R601 (CPU Xeon(R) E5506 * 8, 24GB Memory),
about 3000 calls in a second.

If you want to a thread-able solution, you can try this project of [dawnbreaks].

Installation
-------------

Use the ./install.sh script.

Test
----

See the test directory.

Uninstallation
--------------

Using the uninstall.sh


Notice
--------------
When you do a lot of redis_command() calling in a short time,
you may get a lot of error like this "Connection error on (xxxx/xxx):
Cannot assign requested address" in the error log of MySQL Server.
And, at the same time, you can see a lot of TIME_WAIT in the netstat command
output.

In this case, you can set the kernel parameters or try to modify the code in
hiredis on socket operation (setsockopt() with SO_REUSEADDR).

  >vi /etc/sysctl.conf
  
  >net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1
  
  >net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1
  
  >net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle=1
  

and /sbin/sysctl -p to make it be usefull.
